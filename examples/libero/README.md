# LIBERO Benchmark

This example runs the LIBERO benchmark: https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO

Note: When updating requirements.txt in this directory, there is an additional flag `--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113` that must be added to the `uv pip compile` command.

This example requires git submodules to be initialized. Don't forget to run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## With Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Grant access to the X11 server:
sudo xhost +local:docker

# To run with the default checkpoint and task suite:
SERVER_ARGS="--env LIBERO" docker compose -f examples/libero/compose.yml up --build

# To run with glx for Mujoco instead (use this if you have egl errors):
MUJOCO_GL=glx SERVER_ARGS="--env LIBERO" docker compose -f examples/libero/compose.yml up --build
```

You can customize the loaded checkpoint by providing additional `SERVER_ARGS` (see `scripts/serve_policy.py`), and the LIBERO task suite by providing additional `CLIENT_ARGS` (see `examples/libero/main.py`).
For example:

```bash
# To load a custom checkpoint (located in the top-level openpi/ directory):
export SERVER_ARGS="--env LIBERO policy:checkpoint --policy.config pi05_libero --policy.dir ./my_custom_checkpoint"

# To run the libero_10 task suite:
export CLIENT_ARGS="--args.task-suite-name libero_10"
```

## Without Docker (not recommended)

Terminal window 1:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.8 examples/libero/.venv
source examples/libero/.venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync examples/libero/requirements.txt third_party/libero/requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113 --index-strategy=unsafe-best-match
uv pip install -e packages/openpi-client
uv pip install -e third_party/libero
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/third_party/libero

# Run the simulation
python examples/libero/main.py

# To run with glx for Mujoco instead (use this if you have egl errors):
MUJOCO_GL=glx python examples/libero/main.py
```

Terminal window 2:

```bash
# Run the server
uv run scripts/serve_policy.py --env LIBERO
```

## Privileged deterministic recovery smoke test

`deterministic_c_smoke.py` checks whether a deterministic controller can serve
as policy C for recoverable failures. It currently targets LIBERO-Object task 0,
uses simulator state to locate the object and target, and runs a closed-loop OSC
pick-and-place recovery. It does not use images or a learned policy.

Run it from the repository root in a Python 3.8 LIBERO environment:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/third_party/libero${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"
MUJOCO_GL=osmesa PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=osmesa \
  python examples/libero/deterministic_c_smoke.py --episodes 3
```

Each episode starts from an official LIBERO initial state, moves the task object
to a known failure state, restores that exact state, and asks the controller to
recover. The default output directory is `data/libero/deterministic_c_smoke`;
each `.npz` contains the failure state, recovery states, and recovery actions,
and `summary.json` records stage completion and task success.

## Results

If you want to reproduce the following numbers, you can evaluate the checkpoint at `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_libero/`. This
checkpoint was trained in openpi with the `pi05_libero` config.

| Model | Libero Spatial | Libero Object | Libero Goal | Libero 10 | Average |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| π0.5 @ 30k (finetuned) | 98.8 | 98.2 | 98.0 | 92.4 | 96.85
